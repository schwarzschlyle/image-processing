# Flow Details

1. Learn [[Mathematical Modelling]] guided by mathematical "rigor" of Velten. Apply these principles to
	1. [[Data Science]]
	2. [[Computational Physics]]
2. Do a project and write-up on
	1. [[Phenomenological Model Projects]] (Usually [[Data Science]])
	2. [[Mechanistic Model Projects]] (Usually [[Physics]])
3. Upload on [[GitHub]] and compile as a portfolio: 
https://schwarzschlyle.github.io/portfolio/ here.
1. Write a blog post about it.
2. If sufficient, use [[Manimations]] and try to do a YouTube video (this should come last) by learning how to edit good videos.
3. Use Kaggle for DS projects; use GR papers for GR projects.

# Daily Chronology

With these, here are a suggested chronology. The flow is generally split into a three-way highway. 

1) Work on [[Computational Physics]] projects from Landau and supplement with Sadun, Strogatz, Newman
2) For [[Data Science]], do and compile projects from internship and Kaggle.
3) Learn [[General Relativity]] via 225 and Caroll supplement. Continue to papers afterwards.

# Weekly Chronology

Push at least (1) new project on portfolio/Github repo.

# [[Physics]]

[[Physics]] is simply one kind of [[Mechanistic Models]], a form of [[Mathematical Modelling]]

For [[Theoretical Physics]], we are focusing on [[General Relativity]].  Aim to compile a detailed and organized list of mathematical machineries of [[GR Toolkit]]. Afterwards, dive into [[Numerical Relativity]], read some [[GR Must-Reads]], and derive the calculations of [[Wormholes]].

For [[Computational Physics]], we are aiming to develop multiple projects in-line with learning [[Mathematical Modelling]] > [[Mechanistic Models]].

A complete project consists of the following documentations:
+ Analytical/numerical solution via Python/Mathematica
+ LaTex writeup
+ [[Manimations]]

# [[Data Science]]

Follow typical [[DS Workflow]].

For analytical details, compile them [[Phenomenological Models]]

Compile [[Phenomenological Model Projects]] and push them to https://schwarzschlyle.github.io/portfolio/.

If necessary, you can also do a LaTex writeup or [[Manifold]] if appropriate.

Mathematical Methods directory needs cleaning up.

You can start converting handwritten notes from [[BS Math Methods Outlines]] learned on BS courses.

# [[How to be a human]]?

Core: [[Stoicism Reflections]]

To be an an effective human being, check out guide on [[How to be a human]].

Ongoing note-taking: [[Habit Tier List]], [[Laws of Human Nature]]

Remember the key principles of [[Elements of Effective Thinking]] in building this second brain.
